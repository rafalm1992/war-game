# War game

## Requirements

- The game is played with two players.
- Upon launching, the program displays the game title, and rules, and prompts the users to enter their names.
- After both players provide their names, the program randomly determines which player will start.
- The deck of cards is shuffled before each game. The game uses a standard 52-card deck consisting of four suits: Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, and Clubs. Each suit contains 13 cards: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace
- The game begins with each player receiving 26 cards from the shuffled deck. The received cards remain hidden from both players, and players should not know how many cards they have during the game.
- After the first player makes a move, the program prompts the second player to make their move.
- Players take their turn by pressing Enter when prompted by the program.
- The program reveals the two played cards.
- After both players have made their moves, the two cards are compared. The player with the higher card wins the round, and the program announces the result.
- The winning card(s) are placed at the bottom of the winnerâ€™s deck.
- The ranking of cards from lowest to highest is: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.
- If both cards have the same rank, the program announces a tie and initiates a War.
- During a War, each player is asked to place four cards (one place = one press of enter button), program reveals the last from four cards.
- The two revealed cards are then compared. The player with the higher card wins all the cards on the table. If the revealed cards are again of equal rank, the War continues: each player is asked to place four cards (one place = one press enter), program reveals the last from four cards. - This process repeats until one player wins the matchup.
- The game continues until one player runs out of cards.
- The player who doesn't have card loses the game
- The program announces the winner and then exits.
